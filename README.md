A tower defense game in unity


The goal in the game is to stop the creatures from reaching your castle by building towers that attack them.
Creatures are spawned from the cave and are coming out in waves.
Creature types in order are:
 - Spidey - little spider
 - Arachnola - bigger spider
 - Necro - a necromancer

Towers can be placed on the hills:
 - after clicking on an empty spot it will show a green/grey square
 - green means the spot is available
 - grey means you can't build there
 
 There are currently four kind of towers:
 - fire
 - venom
 - lightning
 - ice
 
 Fire has splash damage
 Venom has dot (damage over time) damage
 Lightning has a faster fire rate, good damage
 Ice slows the enemy it hits
 
 Each tower can be upgraded until it reaches its maximum level (level 3).
